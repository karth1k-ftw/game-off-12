CLONE MAN

CREATED AT 2012

Clone Man was subject of experiment in cloning. The experiment went wrong and now he can clone himself as much as he want. 
Unfortunately the clone is much weaker than him and will disappear after some time. And thus he was thrown out. 
Not giving up, trying to prove himself, now he set up to clear puzzles created by the schemer. Puzzles that can kill him if he is not careful.

A puzzle, memory, retro game with simple graphic. Try to solve the puzzles with only your ability to clone.
